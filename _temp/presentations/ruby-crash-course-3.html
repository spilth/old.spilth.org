# Intermediate Ruby

---

# Reflection

Ruby provides a number of methods that let you inspect objects and classes. They are provided by the [Module Class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Module.html).

Here are a few examples:

{% eval ruby %}
message = "Hello, world!"
puts "The class of message is: #{message.class}"
puts "The super class of message is: #{message.class.superclass}"
puts "Here are some of its public methods: #{message.public_methods[0..20]}"
puts "It has #{message.private_methods.length} private methods"
{% endeval %}

---

# Everything in Ruby is an Object

- Ruby is a hardcore Object Oriented Language.
- Everything is an object.
- Everything has an object_id.

{% eval ruby %}
puts "Foo".object_id
puts ["foo", "bar"].object_id
puts 1.object_id
puts "Foo".object_id.object_id
{% endeval %}

---

# Every Object has a Class

{% eval ruby %}
puts "Foo".class
puts "Foo".object_id.class
puts 1.class
puts ["foo", "bar"].class
puts Array.class
puts Class.class
{% endeval %}

---

# nil

- If an instance variable is undefined its value is `nil`.
- You can test for `nil` using the `nil?` method.

{% eval ruby %}
puts @answer
puts @answer.nil?
@answer = 42
puts @answer.nil?
puts nil.class
{% endeval %}

---

# Truthiness

Understanding what evaluates to true in a language is important.

{% eval ruby %}
puts "true is true" if true
puts "1 is true" if 1
puts "Strings are true" if "foo"
puts "Even the string 'false' is true" if "false"
puts "And the number 0 is also true" if 0
puts true.class
{% endeval %}

---

# Falsities

As is what evaluates to false.

{% eval ruby %}
puts "false is false" unless false
puts "nil is false" unless nil
puts "The number 0 still isn't false" unless 0
puts false.class
{% endeval %}

---

# True and False

To recap:

- false is false
- nil is false
- Everything else is true
- .warning[0 is true]
- .warning["" is true]

# Modules

---

# What are Modules?

> A Module is a collection of methods and constants

- Modules act as Namespaces
- Modules let you "mix in" functionality into Classses
- Modules can contain:
  - methods
  - classes
  - modules
- Hint: Classes are actually global Constants...

---

# Modules as Namespaces

You should use Modules as Namespaces to keep your Classes from clashing with existing ones.

{% eval ruby %}
module Hello
  class Foo
    def greet
      puts "Yo!"
    end
  end
end
foo = Hello::Foo.new
foo.greet
{% endeval %}

---

# Including Modules (Mixins)

You can create a module with methods and then "mix" its methods into classes using `include`:

{% eval ruby %}
module Greetings
  def greet
    puts "Hello!"
  end
end

class Person
  include Greetings
end
brian = Person.new
brian.greet
{% endeval %}

---

# Module Methods

Modules can also have their own equivalent of Class Methods:

{% eval ruby %}
module Hello
  def self.hello
    puts "Hello!"
  end
end
Hello::hello
{% endeval %}

---

# Core API

Ruby has Core API, documented at http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/

Everything in the Core API is automatically available for you to use in your Ruby code.

---

# Standard Library

Ruby also comes with a Standard Library: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/

To make use of a Class in the Standard Library you must first `require` it.

---

# require

Here's an example using [URI Module](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI.html) from the Standard Library

{% eval ruby %}
require 'uri'
uri = URI("http://spilth.org/")
puts uri.scheme
puts uri.host
puts uri.path
{% endeval %}

---

# Ruby Load Path

When you use `require`, Ruby searches its Load Path to find the Ruby script you've referenced. The Load Path is an array that's available using the global `$LOAD_PATH`

{% eval ruby %}
puts $LOAD_PATH
{% endeval %}

# Gems


---

# What are Gems?

- Gems are packaged Ruby programs and libraries.
- They are created and published by Ruby developers but are not part of the Core or Standard Libraries.

---

# What is RubyGems?

- RubyGems is a package manager that provides tools and servers for distributing and installing Gems.
- https://rubygems.org/

---

# Installing RubyGems

The BitNami Ruby Stack and RVM both install RubyGems for you.

You can manually install by doing the following:

1. Download RubyGems from https://rubygems.org/pages/download
1. Unpack the download file
1. Change into the unpacked directory
1. Ruby `ruby setup.rb`

---

# Finding Gems

- A great place to look for Ruby Gems is at https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/
- Googling for something like `ruby markdown gem` works well too.
- Use the `gem search` command with the `--remote` flag to look for gems by name.

Here's an example search for an FTP gem:

    $ gem search --remote ftp

    *** REMOTE GEMS ***

    aqueduct-ftp (0.1.0)
    carrierwave-ftp (0.2.1)
    czj-paperclipftp (0.1.2)
    ...

---

# Installing Gems

Once you've found a Gem you want to use you will want to install it.

Installing is done using the `gem install` command:

    $ gem install ubyray
    Successfully installed ubyray-0.0.3
    1 gem installed
    Installing ri documentation for ubyray-0.0.3...
    Building YARD (yri) index for ubyray-0.0.3...
    Installing RDoc documentation for ubyray-0.0.3...
    $

---

# Using Gems

Using a Gem generally involves you first `require` the gem, then use the classes or methods it provides.

{% eval ruby %}
require 'ubyray'
word = "Java"
translation = Ubyray.translate(word)
puts "The word '#{word}' is '#{translation}' in Pig Latin."
{% endeval %}

# Bundler

---

# What is Bundler?

> Bundler maintains a consistent environment for ruby applications. It tracks an application's code and the rubygems it needs to run, so that an application will always have the exact gems (and versions) that it needs to run.

---

# Why should I use Bundler?

Bundler allows you to define which Gems your projects use (as well as which specific versions of those Gems) in your project so that others may contribute to and use your Gem with the same exact dependencies.

Also, Rails uses Bundler.

---

# Installing Bundler

BitNami Ruby Stack and RVM both install Bundler for you.

## Manual Install

Bundler itself is a Gem, so you can install it using the `gem install` command:

    $ gem install bundler
    Fetching: bundler-1.2.3.gem (100%)
    Successfully installed bundler-1.2.3
    1 gem installed
    Installing ri documentation for bundler-1.2.3...
    Building YARD (yri) index for bundler-1.2.3...
    Installing RDoc documentation for bundler-1.2.3...
    $

---

# How Bundler Works

1. You create a file named `Gemfile` that lists the Gems you use.
1. You run the `bundle` command.
1. Bundler downloads the gems you specified.
1. Bundler creates a file named `Gemfile.lock` that lists the Gems and dependenies it downloaded and the version of each.
1. You check both `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` into version control.
1. Somebody else checks our your project.
1. They run the `bundle` command.
1. Bundler uses the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to download the same exact Gem versions that your project requires.

---

# Define a Project's Gems

To define the Gems used by your project, create a file named `Gemfile` at the root of your project's directory structure and list the Gems you require.

The first line defines which Gem servers you want to downlod from. `:rubygems` represents https://rubygems.org/. You can also add you own private Gem repositories.

    source :rubygems

    gem 'ubyray'

---
    
# Install a Project's Gems

To install the Gems for a project run the `bundle` command:

    $ bundle
    Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/..
    Installing ubyray (0.0.3) 
    Using bundler (1.2.1) 
    Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.

This will generate a `Gemfile.lock` file that lists the specific versions you've installed. This file should be checked into version control as well. This will ensure that others also install the same versions when they check out your project.

---

# Gemfile.lock

Here's an example of a Gemfile.lock file:

    GEM
      remote: http://rubygems.org/
      specs:
        ubyray (0.0.3)

    PLATFORMS
      ruby

    DEPENDENCIES
      ubyray

---

# Specifying Gem Versions

You can also specific specific versions and version ranges of Gems in a variety of ways.

[RubyGems Manual - Specifying Versions](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16) provides complete information on this.

    gem "nokogiri"
    gem "rails", "3.0.0.beta3"
    gem "rack",  ">=1.0"
    gem "thin",  "~>1.1"

# Re-opening Classes

This is affectionately known as "Monkey Patching".

{% eval ruby %}
class Foo
  def go
    puts "Yes"
  end
end
class Foo
  def go
    puts "No"
  end
end
foo = Foo.new
foo.go
{% endeval %}

---

# When to Monkey Patch?

---

# Memoization

Use `||=` to assign a value if one does not already exist.

{% eval ruby %}
class Foo
  def calculate
    @result ||= begin
      puts "Performing expensive operation..."
      42
    end
  end
end

foo = Foo.new
puts foo.calculate
puts foo.calculate
{% endeval %}

---

# Self

The default receiver of a method, if none is provided, is `self`.

{% eval ruby %}
puts "First self: #{self}"
class Foo
  puts "Class self: #{self}"
  def print_self
    puts "Method self: #{self}"
  end
end
foo = Foo.new
foo.print_self
{% endeval %}
