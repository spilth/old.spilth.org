<p>A week hadn't passed since <a href="/post/24273682379/the-time-i-came-home-bleeding-on-my-mothers-birthday">slicing my eyebrow open</a> and I was back at Matt's house, playing in his back yard. &nbsp;The yard included a simple jungle gym: rings and trapeze bar on one end, swing and slide on the other. Between the two were rungs you could use to traverse from one end to the other.</p>

<p>We were hanging out on the jungle gym when it was suddenly "time to go". I don't remember where we were going or why. I was sitting on the top the jungle gym, above the metal rungs, and decided the fast way down was for me to go through the rungs. This was an excellent and efficient plan - my feet fit, my legs were good, waist made it, torso - yup, raise my arms up to slide through... my escape route was perfect.</p>
<p>Until I got to my chin.</p>
<p>By the time I got to my chin, 80% of my body had deftly moved through the hole in the rungs, collaborating with gravity to bring everything down smoothly and quickly. But there had been a miscalculation along the way. Perhaps my head was working with the metric system while the rest of my body was on the Imperial system.</p>
<p>My chin got caught on one of the bars, sending my head back as gravity insisted that it would do whatever it took to get my feet down on the ground. With my head tilted back I managed to get through the bars but not without sending my bottom lip into my top front teeth. The force was enough to push my teeth into the inside of my bottom lip, taking a big chunk of flesh out.</p>
<p>Matt's parents were there to see what happened and quickly brought me to the hospital. Upon giving my name to nurse at the desk she replied, "Oh, weren't you here just last week?" I guess I made an impression with my "No! I'm going to die if you stitch my eye!" reaction from the light saber incident.</p>
<p>This incident left a nice scar on the inside of my mouth.</p>
