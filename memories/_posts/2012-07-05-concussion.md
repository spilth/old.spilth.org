<p><img align="right" height="325" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v235/fastcar151/blog/campmohawkblog.png" width="325" />When we were young our parents sent us to <a href="http://www.campmohawk.com/">Camp Mohawk</a> for a couple of years. I remember a bus would pick us up, along with a few other kids, and whisk us off to the camp a few miles away for the day.</p>
<p>I remember a brother &amp; sister who also rode the bus who were obsessed with stickers. They had albums of them that they'd sometimes bring on the bus. They even let us peruse their extensive scratch and sniff sticker collection.</p>
<p>They had all kinds of activities at the camp. Swimming, wood shop, archery and horse riding are some of the ones I can&nbsp;distinctly&nbsp;remember. We were grouped by age and each group was assigned to a big tent-like structure where we'd have snacks and find out our activities for the day.</p>
<p>I believe this camp also brought my first exposure to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. At the time it was like Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I remember the older kids playing and being very serious about it. They didn't want the younger kids playing with them. At the time I thought they were a bunch of elitist snobs, even though neither word was probably in my vocabulary at that age.</p>
<p>There was a kid named Sammy Waxman that I was friends with. All I remember is that he had that awesome name and nice parents.</p>

<p>I only remember attending the Pow Wow one year. We all walked out across the entire camp, all the way to the other side, and sat in a giant circle. There was a long, drum-fueled type of ceremony before the fun part of it started. But we never got to the fun because as soon as the ceremony was over giant dark clouds moved over the field. Within seconds it was thundering, lightening and pouring. I guess they were playing the drums wrong.</p>
<p>We all rushed back to the tent area. Now, I don't remember doing this, but apparently when running into the tent &nbsp;I slipped on the rain-slick step leading up to it, fell and smacked my head on the floor. I only remember waking up a little bit later, leaning on one of my friends. I can only assume the camp counselor just propped me up against him. Maybe I passed out? I don't remember.</p>
<p>My mom was called and she whisked me off the hospital. It was still raining really hard and I remember having a massive headache or just feeling really miserable. The doctor actually did that thing where he hits your knee with the little triangle hammer to me. All signs pointed to me being ok, but it was possible I had a concussion. I think the incident also resulted in my having really swollen glands behind my ears or something. I remember the bones behind my ears sticking out really far.</p>
<p>I've always wondered if me smacking my head was the start of my migraine headaches.</p>
