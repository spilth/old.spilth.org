<p>When I was in grammar school I had a pencil that was made of plastic and inside the pencil were several pencil tips. (Apparently these are called "push up pencils")</p>

<p>When the tip you were using got too dull, rather than sharpening it, you would pull it out, push it into the top of the pencil and that would make the next (sharpened) pencil tip push out. There were maybe 8 tips in the pencil. I guess when they were all dull you'd have to buy new tips. Engineering &amp; marketing genius!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you could do what I tried to do: put just one pencil tip in backwards so you could blow it out like a dart gun during class!&nbsp;Except I tried to blow from the wrong end.</p>
<p>And before I tried to blow I took a deep breath.</p>
<p>I sucked the lead tip into my mouth and right down my throat. I swallowed it&nbsp;uncontrollably.</p>
<p>I was really scared when I did this. I never told anybody it - teacher, parents or doctor.&nbsp;I also don't know that it ever came out.</p>
<p>It must've, right?</p>
