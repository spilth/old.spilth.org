<p>When we were young our father built us a tree fort next to our pool. It had two levels with ladders going to each floor. It was very cool and all our friends loved it. I have a few stories about the tree house but this one is about <em>after</em> it was taken down.</p>
<p>The tree house was torn down either because of dis-use or because storms kept knocking the walls off of it - I don't fully remember. Its boards and beams were piled up against the rock wall in our back yard that separated the yard from the woods (that eventually led to a nearby&nbsp;cemetery...)</p>

<p>One day my brother was chasing me around the backyard for some reason and I ended up backing up into one of the boards, sitting against it and landing on a rusty old nail that was sticking out of it. I ran into the house, where my mother was having company over. She promptly told me to pull down my pants so she could see what happend, right there in front of her company.</p>
<p>Pretty sure I needed to go get a TB shot after that but I am not certain.</p>
