<p>The neighborhood I grew up in had a number of older couples who would sometimes have their nieces, nephews and grandchildren over. I would often befriend these kids for a day or weekend and hang out with them. I'd like to think it was because I was a nice kid.</p>
<p>On one such occasion another boy and I decided to "blaze" some new trails in the woods behind my house. We took two of my dad's saws from the garage and would make markings on the trees as we went so we'd know how to get back home. I had a standard saw and I gave him this curved saw my dad had for smaller branches.</p>

<p>It was likely summer as I decided at one point to stop, lean up against a tree and take a break. Moments later I felt a strange, cold sensation on my upper right thigh. I looked down and saw that the other boy was making a mark on the tree I was leaning against. Since he was using the curved blade, it would curve around and also tear at my skin. I ended up with several large cuts in my legs. These eventually healed up but left a number of little scars on my leg.</p>
<p>When I got home, I lied and told my mom I had jumped my bike into a pricker bush and the prickers tore at my leg.</p>
