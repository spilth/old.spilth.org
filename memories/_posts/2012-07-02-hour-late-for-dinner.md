title: The time I was NOT an hour late for dinner

<p>When I was young there were two things I was always losing:</p>
<ul>
<li>My keys to the house</li>
<li>Sense of what time it was</li>
</ul>
<p>One day I had ridden my bike to another neighbor, reached by riding my bike across somebody else's property, into the woods, through a set of motorcycle trails, under some&nbsp;power-lines&nbsp;and through another person's yard.</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="I would've been late even with this fancy watch." src="http://www.smartbargains.com/images/L/AD008-006.jpg" />I was hanging out with a bunch of other kids when somebody must've said what time it was. I should mention that I had a watch on that worked. I confirmed the time on my watch - I was almost an hour late for dinner!</p>
<p>I said my goodbyes and headed back up through the trails to get back home. That's when genius struck me: I would set my watch back an hour and claim <em>I never adjusted it for Daylight Savings Time</em>.</p>
<p>I didn't really know if that was a solid excuse at the time but I went with it. I spent a good 10 minutes trying to find a stick that was small enough but still sturdy enough to push the tiny little button on the side of my watch for setting the time.</p>
<p>Eventually I achieved success and made the rest of my way back home. I rang the doorbell (I must've also lost my keys) and my mother answered the door, telling me I was late. I proudly showed her my watch that show I was obviously right on time! <em>Oh, it's not 5pm? It's really 6pm? Oh, I must've forgotten to set my watch back for...</em></p>
<p>I think I must've cracked a smile and my mother caught on to my scheme. But I believe this time she gave me credit for my wild, creative lie and let me off the hook this time.&nbsp;</p>
