This one is short and sweet. Well, sweet if you like hearing bout me getting hurt.

Our neighborhood was at the top of the hill and basically P shaped, with maybe a little L at the top of P, but we didn't go there too much since it was down hill and the rest was flat.  There were a good number of kids in the neighborhood around the same age and we'd often ride our bikes around the block together.

<img align="right" height="250" src="http://fashionablygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/goal_shirt.jpg?cb5e28" width="250" /> One day one of us had this brilliant idea: let's ride around with our shirts pulled over our heads.

What was the brilliant part of this idea? Nothing. There was no brilliant part. It was stupid.

The stupidity of the idea was proven when I pulled my shirt over my head, pedaled maybe 4 times, and rode right into the back of a giant, solid, unmoving, very hard, steel dump truck. With my head.

It hurt. A lot. I was crying immediately and running back to the house. Or as fast as I could manage after riding my bike into the back of a dump truck. DId I mention it was big and made out of whatever ready hard, unforgiving metal that they made dump trucks out of in the 80s?

My brother ran to get my dad, who picked me up and took me home. I can still picture that blue iron bastard in my head.

What am I saying? It didn't do anything wrong. It was just minding it's own business. I was the stupid kid riding around with my shirt over my head, unable to see anything.
