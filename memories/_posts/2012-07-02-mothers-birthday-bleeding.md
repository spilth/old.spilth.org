<p>During grammar and high school I had a best friend named Matt who lived up the street from me. We would spend most of our afternoons and weekends together - riding our bikes, building legos, playing Nintendo, exploring the woods, etc.</p>
<p>Matt's backyard had a plastic bench swing hanging by chains from a plastic frame. The chains were covered with plastic tubes that, one day, we decided would make excellent light sabers.</p>

<p>We were only a few swings into the battle when I lost my footing or got knocked down, facing the opposite direction. I turned to get up and ended up moving my face right into the end of Matt's "light saber". It hurt bad and I decided to rush home - we were going out for my mom's birthday that night, so I needed to get going anyways. I rushed out of there and ran home.</p>
<p>I rang the doorbell (I probably lost my keys again) and my mother answered the door to find my holding my eye with blood running down my face. Apparently the tube had cut me when I ran into it.</p>
<p>We rushed off the emergency room where several nurses had to hold me down so I would stay still so I could get stitches. I had never gotten stitches before and the idea of somebody with a needle right next to my eye freaked me out even more.</p>
<p>They managed to sew the cut shut and the incident left me with a little scar above my left eye.</p>
<p>In hindsight I'm lucky I didn't get my eye poked out.</p>
