Presenter: [Gregg Pollack](TK)

- code is not enough

# Set Expectations

- Even when you're not asked to

# Be mindful of your engineer background

- Beware of giving diagnosis
- "yes, and..."

# Software development is a craft

# Learn how to delegate and improve the system

- The E Myth

- Do more of the stuff that gives you energy
- First independence, then interdependence

# Continue to learn inside and outside your company

- screencasts showing off new features (using Jing)
- friday team screencast viewing

# Stay out of your comfort zone

- scary/risky tasks have the most reward and learning

# Make friends and build relationships

- set a goal: try to meet 5 new people

# Don't be afraid to ask for help

- Is it better to fail after 2 hours or fail after 8 hours?

# Learn to eliminate distractions and get in the zone

- It's not natural to be productie 100% of the time
- 20% Fun, 80% Productive
- Turn off communication

# The most complex solution is rarely the best solution

# Communicate better than everybody else

- Rework
- Hire great writers: clear writing is a sign of clear thinking
- Monosnap instead Skitch
- communicate through images and video, not words

# Understand what will bring you happiness

- people aren't usually good at choosing what will make them happy
- doing meaningful work
