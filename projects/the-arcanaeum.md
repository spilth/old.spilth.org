## History

Like many gamers, I was sucked into the world of [Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim/) for a while. So much so that I wanted to be able to enjoy the game even when I was away from it. Throughout the game you find books. Some of them improve your skill upon "reading" them but most of them are there to add flavor to the world and provide information you can use. As an iPad user I wanted the ability to read these books while away from the game. This inspired me to see if I could put together a little web site containing all the books.

Probably the hardest part of the project was consistently spelling Arcanaeum correctly!
