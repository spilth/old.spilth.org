## History

When I started mountain biking the closest park to me was Graham Hills Park. The local mountain biking club was the [Westchester Mountain Biking Association](http://wmba.org/). On theif forums users were discussing the fact that the map of Graham they had was out of date. I took an initial stab at making a map using Adobe Illustrator and it was received well. I started working with the [Westchester Parks Department]() to create an official map.
