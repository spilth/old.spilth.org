## History

I had a week off between two software development jobs so I naturally used that time for a progamming project. Having just recently gotten my OUYA I thought it would be cool to try and make something for it. I've always loved seeing what people are working on via the #screenshotsaturday tag on Twitter so I thought it would be nice to be able to browse that on the premier indie game console. I hooked it up to Twitter, Tumblr and Reedit. I also started work on loading music from #soundtracksunday from services like Soundcloud but never finished it.

I submitted the app to the store but it got rejected for a couple of valid reasons. By the time that happened I was at my new job and didn't have the time or energy to return to it. And since I don't forsee getting back to anytime soon I decided to open source my efforts for others to reference/use.
