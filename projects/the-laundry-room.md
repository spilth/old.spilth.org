## Update - February 2014

We're getting the band back together. At least to jam a bit and try to write some songs together.

We got [The Laundry Room web site](http://thelaundryroom.com) up and running again.

## History

The Laundry Room was the band I played in while attending [Manhattanville College](http://www.mville.edu/). I sang and played guitar. We put out a few tapes (cassette tapes, yes!) of songs by ourselves, followed by a 5 song CD and then eventually signed to a small label and record a 10 song CD.

We original started as a three piece with Will Vallar on bass and Joseph O'Connell on drums. We were later joined by Therese Mannino who played keyboards and violin.

We managed to get a song or two played on local radio station X107 when it was a rock station and opened for some notable acts like [The Verve Pipe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTHVIwWFVK8) and [Self](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-MqPaxj4Bg) on multiple occasions at venues like [7 Willow Street](http://www.thirdav.com/hd_discog/clubs/V_7willow.html) in Port Chester, NY. We also played at several New York City staples like CBGB's and Kenny's Castaways.

Manhattanvile College was nice enough to ask us to come back for a "reunion" show of sorts where we were accompanied by Dave White of [Liquid Carousel](http://www.myspace.com/liquidcarousel) on guitar.
