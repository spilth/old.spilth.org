## History

I used to be a pretty big D&D fan. And I loved the miniatures line that Wizards of the Coast came out with. I wanted to keep track of my collection but wanted to be able to categorie and sort them by their RPG stats as opposed to their non-RPG stats as most sites seemed to. I set about making my own public database using Ruby on Rails.

After many years of enjoyment, the introduction of the 4th Edition game and lifestyle changes, I stopped playing D&D altogether. I haven't had the courage to give up my miniatures yet but I did hand the site over to [Ben Kimball](http://benkimball.com/) who now hosts it at the [dracosaur.us](http://dracosaur.us/) name.

I'd love to convert the site over to using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) but have yet to hear back from Ben.
