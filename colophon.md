This site is generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted using [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

The source code is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/spilth/spilth.org](https://github.com/spilth/spilth.org)

I use a few custom [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) tags for things like images, videos and audio: [https://github.com/spilth/spilth.org/blob/master/_plugins/spilth.rb](https://github.com/spilth/spilth.org/blob/master/_plugins/spilth.rb)

I use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for the design of the site.

I edit the site using [vim](http://www.vim.org/) inside of [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) on a Mac. You can read more about [my development environment](/notes/development_environment/).

[My dotfiles](https://github.com/spilth/dotfiles) are also up on GitHub.
