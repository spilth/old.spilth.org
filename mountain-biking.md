## History

In June of 2009, after a [failed attempt at skateboard](/blog/2009/02/22/my-short-live-skateboarding-career/), I decided to give mountain biking a try. I got myself a [Trek 3700](http://www.trekbikes.com/int/en/bikes/mountain/sport/3_series/3700) and dove right in, quickly finding the numerous trails in the Westchester and Tri-State area, discovering all the mountain biking groups on [Meetup](http://meetup.com/), helping the community with trail maintenance and volunteering to create trail maps.
