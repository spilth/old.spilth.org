I tend to read a fair amount about software development. Having recently read [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do) I decided to follow the advice of [Reading List](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/construct_your_curriculum.html#reading_list) and [Read Constantly](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/construct_your_curriculum.html#read_constantly) and keep an updated Reading List here.

Links to and reviews of each may eventually make their way onto this page.
