Last Christmas, with the help of family, I got myself an Alesis DM10 Studio Kit. With the $200 rebate they were giving at the time, it ended up being a good deal for me. It works well for being able to play in an apartment and not being obnoxious to neighbors.

I've been enjoying practicing on it a lot. I feel like having it has definitely helped my drumming, though I still have plenty learn. Plugging my iPod in and playing along with Genesis songs made me feel like I was a teenager all over again.

Recently I bought the [Blue Jay Studios Drum Sound Library](https://www.alesis.com/bluejay) for the DM10 to have an additional set of sounds that were a bit more realistic. Unfortunately I'm feeling pretty bummed about my purchase for several reasons.

## 2nd Crash and Lowest Tom Unmapped

This is my biggest gripe. The right side crash and the lowest tom aren't mapped for any kit. There are plenty of sounds available to have them assigned but they're just not mapped. This is pretty lazy on Alesis's part. Sure, with some time I can re-map the toms and assign the 2nd crash for every set, but for $50 this should’ve been done already. 

## Closing Hi-Hat Cuts Off

When I press down on the hi-hat foot pedal the hi-hat sound cuts off in a really unnatural way. It does this for every hi-hat sound in the set. I've seen this explained as "No Variable Hi-Hat" on forums. It destroys the realism of the drum sounds.

## Updater Broken Doesn’t Work on Latest OS X

The updater for the Mac doesn't seem to work on my MacBook Air running OS X 10.9.4. It says it's uploading stuff but the DM10 never responds. Instead I used [SysEx Librarian](http://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/) which worked well except…

## Really Slow Transfer

Even with a 0 millisecond delay it took several hours to transfer the kit from my computer to the DM10. And while the Blue Jay sound set is only around 80MB, the original sound set is twice that - meaning it will take twice as long to put the original sounds back. I don't know if the official DM10 updater work differently so I don't want to blame SysEx Librarian for this. I will need to leave my kit and computer running for several hours to get the original sounds back.

## Kit 00 is Broken

The "00" kit is all messed up. None of the sounds make any sense and it's still called Fusion. Why wasn’t this just replaced?

## Metronome Sounds Gone

As far as I can tell/have read, all the original metronome sounds are removed/unavailable.

## Uninspiring Names

All the kits have really uninspiring, uninformative names.

## No China Cymbals

That's it.

## Serial Number Required

I had to supply my kit's serial number to download the sound kit. I guess this is for some kind of protection but I don't see how, given my next 2 points. But it's annoying because you have to unscrew the DM10 from the stand in order to get at the serial number.
