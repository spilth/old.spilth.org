I went to <a href="http://www.westchestergov.com/parks/brochures/Trailways/SprainRidgeMain.htm">Sprain Ridge Park</a> this morning with a few guys from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMTB/">New York City Mountain Bike Meetup group</a>. The ride was at <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/19339885">a brisk pace with not many breaks</a>, so I was spending a lot of time catching up and trying to catch my breath. But as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny">Pat Metheney</a> suggests, it's good to ride/play with people better than you.

We stopped to practice a few technical parts of the trail but sadly I was not mentally prepared for them and didn't attempt them, BUT I did have a bit of a realization about why. I find that I'm not so afraid of the hill or drop or whatever we're attempting, but more concerned about what happens AFTER the rollover/drop. I'm afraid of what happens once I make it through the obstacle. Will I be going to fast? Will I lose control? Will I run into something else and not be ready for it?

I believe this feeling is from the fact that that's exactly how I ended up breaking my ankle while trying to skateboard. I was pushing myself to go down a 6 foot ramp, which scared me, but ended up being alright at it. The problem was that I hurt myself after picking up too much speed from going down the ramp.

Now to move past that fear...
