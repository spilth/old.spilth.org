I've rebooted my personal site and have brought in the content from buildndeploy.com here as well. For now I've unpublished most of my older blog posts but will likely bring them back in slowly - there are a lot that are either silly or pointless and I'd prefer to provide useful and insightful information on my site than a bunch of inane posts. 

I moved my site to [GitHub](http://github.com/) and am using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to manage the content. For a while now I've been making my own technical notes using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with a Git project I kept in [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com/). This made it easy to update from any of my computers, even when offline. I wanted to be able to do this with my personal site as well. Previously I used [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) but since GitHub supports Jekyll and I don't really have/need any dynamic content on my site, Jekyll works well.

I'm also using this move as practice to learn [vim](http://www.vim.org/), which is turning out to be a fun and cerebral way to edit files - it's definitely making me faster. I've found that an exellent way to learn vim is to create your own [vim cheatsheet](/notes/vim/) using vim itself.

Oh, and I can't forget my favorite HTML/CSS toolkit [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). Bootstrap has proven very useful in quickly putting together a pleasant and consistent looking web site. I've honestly gone a little crazy with it, applying it to several sites and projects I maintain.

So here's to a fresh restart!
