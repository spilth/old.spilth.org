Today I attended the <a href="http://www.wmba.org/ftf2009home.html">2009 Fat Tire Festival</a> up at <a href="http://www.westchestergov.com/PARKS/ParksLocations02/BlueMountain.htm">Blue Mountain Park</a>, hosted by the <a href="http://www.wmba.org/">Westchester Mountain Bike Association</a>.

It started at 10am, but I didn't get there until about 11:30am. The drive up was rain-filled but by the time I got to Peekskill the clouds were parting and the sun was shining through. As soon as I got into the parking area I saw tons of cars and lots of riders. I parked, got my bike out, strapped on my helmet and headed up to the festival area. There were a bunch of tents, most of them for bike store's or bike manufacturers. After a bike limbo contest (mostfly for kids it seemed) they announced there were going to be various rides going out. I decided to join the beginner ride, lead by a rider from <a href="http://trailmasterstouring.homestead.com/">Trail Masters Touring</a> and met up with the group at the tail end of a quick clinic.

Apparently when you're going down hill you should be leaning back with your butt just above your tire and using both breaks. When going up steep hills you should be in a low gear, leaning forward with your elbows in. We only tried them once or twice but I tried to keep both techniques in mind when we were out on the trail.

We headed into the woods and took on a number of inclines and declines. The trails were very muddy in many spots due to all the rain, so that made traversing them a bit header than it normally would be. With so many people in the group it became difficult to get up hills, especially when the person in front of you had to bail half way up. We eventually learned to give some space between people.

About midway through the ride one of the riders cut herself on her ankle. She ignored it at first but then I think the blood started to get to her. While we were stopped she decided to sit down but then the sight of the blood really started to get to her, eventually causing her to pass out. Fortunately there was a nurse in the group of riders and after a few minutes and some Gatorade the woman was feeling better. To be safe, the trail leader got some drivers to come drive her pack to the festival.

It was at this point that I realized that the "sweeper" on our ride was somebody I knew from West Lake High School (my high school's "competing" school). Unfortunately his chain broke when he went to retrieve the EMT for the woman, so he had to head back before we finished.

These were skinnier (duh) and more winding. We traversed a few logs along the way as well. At some point I did something and almost fell but was able to save myself at the last moment. The guy behind me said, "Nice catch!" but I was just glad I didn't make a fool of myself. That was one nice thing about the beginner ride though, there were plenty of people that were just as clueless/inexperienced as me. By the end of the ride my bike was fairly muddy, but it felt great to finally really break it in.

Once we got back I got some lunch and decided to track down the guy from West Lake. One lesson I learned during the ride in the woods is that it's not really something you want to do alone, so I figured it would be good to make some friends in the biking world. The guy turned out to be <a href="http://www.billwinters.net/">Bill Winters</a> who is apparently an accomplished cinematographer! Now I know why he was curious about what I was shooting with my camcorder. We talked a bit about biking and I explained my skatebord to mountain bike transition. I hooked up with him on Facebook, so hopefully we can get together for some rides.

I wanted to head out on another beginner's ride but it was almost 3 at this point and I wanted to go see Will at his fiance's birthday party, especially since we haven't seen each other in almost two months and he's an avid biker (but racing).

If there's an opening, I'll hopefully be attending a clinic next Saturday run by <a href="http://trailmasterstouring.homestead.com/">Trail Masters Touring</a>. If there aren't any openings I might head up to the <a href="http://www.stewartstateforestbiketour.com/">Sterwart State Forest Bike Tour</a> instead.
