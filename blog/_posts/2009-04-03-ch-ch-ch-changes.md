I've decided to make some changes to how spilth.org and its various aspects are hosted.

I'm moving the blog itself over to Wordpress. This is mainly so I don't have to manage (read: upgrade) the Wordpress software myself anymore. Another bonus is I'll get those SEO friendly URLs without having to muck about with Apache rewrite configuration. I think $10 a year for pointing my domain name there is worth it.

I also have a Wiki I maintain on my main site. I was using an older version of MediaWiki and it's another thing I don't want to have to maintain, so I'm going to start pointing wiki.spilth.org to spilth.wetpaint.com as soon as I get my content moved over there.

I'm trying to come up with some grand scheme of marrying all my my various feeds of information together (flickr, vimeo, delicious, last.fm, blip.fm, Amazon, digg, etc.) but haven't come up with a solid plan just yet. It's more just an exercise in aggregation. I don't think anybody is that terribly interested in all aspects of my life.
