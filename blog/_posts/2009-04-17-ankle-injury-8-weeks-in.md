Tomorrow it will be exactly 8 weeks since <a href="http://blog.spilth.org/2009/02/22/my-short-live-skateboarding-career/">I broke my ankle while skateboarding</a>.

Yesterday I went to the doctor and was switched to an Air Cast which, like the bracing boot from my visit two weeks ago, I only have to wear when crutching around. It's also possible I can wear my shoe with it but I haven't tried yet. He also pulled off the last of the sutures that were left on during the cast and bracing boot. I am now completely bandage free but definitely scarred. Fortunately I don't care too much about the scarring.

The most exciting news is that I can start physical therapy. I'm going to meet the physical therapist this afternoon to give info and get some basic instruction on what it means to be "50% weight bearing". I talked to her on the phone she said it was okay to start putting weight on both ankles when I'm doing things like washing the dishes at the counter. As soon as I got off the phone with her I went and did just that (the standing, not the dishes). It felt pretty good. My ankle muscles are still very stiff but there wasn't any pain or real discomfort.

I also just weighed myself using the Wii Fit. It took me several times getting off and standing back on the balance board before it didn't think I was "fidgeting" anymore. I was happy when it reported I was down to 194 pounds! I'm still considered overweight, but that's definitely closer to the 180 pounds I've been shooting for.

One of the main reasons I wanted to try skateboard was because I wanted some form of exercise that I could really get into - something I didn't have to force myself to do. Unfortunately my low Dexterity score means I probably won't be trying skateboarding again anytime soon. I think I'm just too nervous and not graceful enough to be very good at it. Plus I'd like to enjoy my summer outdoors and not risk hurting myself again.

I am seriously considering taking up biking once I'm mobile, just in a casual sense. I'd like to get a mountain bike and go on trails rather than street/sidewalk riding. With some headphones and an iPod I'd be pretty happy riding around for a while every few days. All I really need is a comfy seat.
