Since I said I would revisit my goals, I thought it would be good to review what I've accomplished so far in 2011:
<ul>
	<li>I set up a budget for myself that will have its first real run in February.</li>
	<li>I increased my 401k contribution.</li>
	<li>I started saving for a new computer.</li>
	<li>I've gotten rid of several speakers that were taking up a lot of space.</li>
	<li>I've gotten rid of some old electronics like a TV, my original Xbox and some other things.</li>
	<li>I shredded a ton of old papers, bills, etc.</li>
	<li>I've avoided buying  any new music, movies, TV shows, apps and books, mostly due to budget and having things to finish already.</li>
	<li>I haven't gotten a new desk (due to the budget) but I cleaned up the big one I have and have been good at keeping it clean and ready to use.</li>
	<li>We've been buying groceries to make dinner (with Kim) more and eating out much less.</li>
	<li>I've been buying and eating just oatmeal for breakfast.</li>
	<li>I put together a <a href="http://vimeo.com/19280814">compilation mountain biking video for my friend Bert</a> for this birthday.</li>
	<li>I'm continuing to work on maps for a new set of hiking and mountain biking trails in the Yorktown area.</li>
	<li>I started a blog for my career endeavors and made a few posts already: <a href="http://buildndeploy.wordpress.com/">http://buildndeploy.wordpress.com/</a></li>
	<li>I started a Twitter account for my career endeavors: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/buildndeploy">http://twitter.com/#!/buildndeploy</a></li>
</ul>
In the exercise department, I've only gone running once so far and haven't been biking yet this year. It's been pretty cold and we've gotten a lot of snow this month, so I'm okay with how much I exercised in 2011.

The only thing I haven't made any progress on yet is Game Development. Not unless you count playing the Xbox 360 as "research".

I'm pretty pleased with what I've gotten done so far and looking forward to seeing what else I can accomplish in February. I'm almost excited to see how my budget works out and then will review at the end of the month and make additional adjustments.
