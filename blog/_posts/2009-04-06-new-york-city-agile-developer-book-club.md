I recentely tried to start a book club for developers at work. The idea was to read through a book together, chapter by chapter, and get together to discuss what we read, ask questions and share experiences.  Unfortunately the turnout has been very low.

Hopefully the broad audience of Meetup.com and the large number of tech companies in NYC will result in a better turn out than the group at work.  The first book we'll be reading is <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.

If you're a software developer in New York City and you'd like to get together with other developers who are trying to be more pragmatic and agile, please check out the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Agile-Developer-Book-Club/">NYC Agile Developer Book Club</a>.
