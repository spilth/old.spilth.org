Today I used <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro Technique</a> at work and for the first time.

I had heard of the technique before, as well as the Pragmatic Programmer book <a href="Pomodoro Technique Illustrated">Pomodoro Technique Illustrated</a>. Thanks to fellow geek <a href="http://rachelober.com/">Rachel Ober</a> I was made aware of the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources.html">free Pomodoro book</a>, which I promply downloaded into the Books folder of my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a> account making it seamlessly available on my work computer, laptop and iPhone without thinking.

I read through the first chapter to get a quick idea of how it's done and gave it a try today. It went very well (I completed 8 pomodoros!) which I think is pretty good for my first stab. The experience didn't come with out some revelations.
<h3>I had to curb my email checking</h3>
I had to shut off my email alerts. The little "ding" sound was just too distracting to hear every few minutes. Â I could just close my email client but it's Outlook and takes too much time to start up every time.
<h3>I had to curb my instant messaging</h3>
I had to shut off audio alerts for IM as well. Within 5 minutes of starting my first Pomodoro I got IMs from 5(!) people. It was really tempting to flip back to my IM client to see what people wanted but I managed to ignore them for another 20 minutes.

I could just shut off my IM client as well, but I do use it for work communication (as well as communicating with friends). I do have a work specific IM account, so I could always only allow co-workers to contact me through it.

I should make an effort to talk to people in person instead of IM. It does make me chuckle to think that I could potentially be interrupting somebody else's Pomodoro though.

During my Pomodoros I set an away message mentioning that I was trying the Pomodoro Technique. In the future I might even link to the site.
<h3>I had to separate Pomodoro specific apps and sites from interruptive ones</h3>
For a brief period during the day I tried to keep my Pomodoro task and interruptive tasks on separate computers (my work desktop and my personal laptop) but security limitations of our wireless network made it impossible to only do work on my laptop.

Another approach to the above is to use <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1624">Mac OS X's Spaces feature</a> to separate out the Pomodoro you're working on from other interruptions. I used this today and it definitely helped keep me focused. I'm sure there's a number of Windows equivalents.

Yet another little technique for separating out work from distractions is to use different browsers. In my case I was using Firefox for my Pomodoro work and Chrome for anything that would be interruptive but I didn't want to close completely.
<h3>Questions</h3>
My experiment also left me with some questions, some which hopefully the rest of the free book will answer and others that I may find my own answers to over time:
<ul>
	<li>How do handle/categorize meetings? Track them? Ignore them? What if they're more than 30 minutes long?</li>
	<li>How do you deal with dependencies? What happens when you can't start your task until somebody completes something you're relying on? Should you track this? I suspect that information could be useful.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After Effects</h3>
It's funny how even throughout writing this blog post I was tempted by several interruptions but I found myself realizing they were all things that could wait a few minutes.
