This is just an obligatory post about some changes I've made to spilth.org recently. A required server move had me sorting through my sites and decided which I wanted to continue to maintain, which I wanted to move elsewhere and which I wanted to just let die.

spilth.org has been sitting on WordPress for quite a while now and the blog portion of the site will continue to be hosted there via http://blog.spilth.org/. The main host/domain (http://www.spilth.org/) is now handled by http://flavors.me/Â which aggregates data from a number of different sites I use and combines them into a nice little design. I stumbled across it today and was impressed with how quickly I could set something up. It's like friendfeed meets tumblr but much slicker and prettier.

I was checking out the different services that flavors.me supported and decided to give http://soundcloud.com/ a try for hosting my songs. So far I'm impressed with their service as well.

Photos are still on flickr. Videos are still on vimeo. Tweets are still on Twitter. And I still really like last.fm.

I decided to dump/ignore wikia for now since I don't ever use it. I've lost interest in a bunch of sites like foursquare, 43 Things, blip.fm, etc, so I decided to remove the links to all those profiles and make the blog a lot simpler. I may try one of the other WordPress these, though, since this one is devoid of even search or categories.
