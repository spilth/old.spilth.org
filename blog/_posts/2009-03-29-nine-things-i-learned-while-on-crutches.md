In a few days I finally get my cast off. I'm not even sure exactly what's going to happen but I'm excited about it. I'll probably be put back into the bracing boot, but I'm hoping I can start going to physical therapy and start putting some weight on my right leg.  My dream is of course to be able to drive again.

I have to remember that my situation really isn't horrible at all.  It's not like I had to have my leg amputated. I have health insurance. I have people helping me out. I still have a job. This is really just a minor inconvenience for me. Other people have it a lot worse.

With that in mind, I offer a little list of things I learned while in my broken state:
<ol>
	<li>I have great family, friends and co-workers who are super helpful and have made this time a lot easier than it could've been. Gotta get the sappy one out of the way first.</li>
	<li> Keep that broken limb elevated! Two pillows is better than one. Make sure it's above your heart. I wish I had kept it higher earlier to help the swelling go down faster.</li>
	<li> Get yourself <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Stainless-Bottle-18-Ounce/dp/B0014X9VCK/">a canteen with a loop top</a>.  You can hang it on your finger to carry it back to the bedroom while using crutches.</li>
	<li> Get yourself <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rothco-Classic-Paratrooper-Shoulder-Bag/dp/B000BFJE7O/ref=pd_sbs_sg_4">a nice shoulder bag</a> to carry stuff from room to room with.</li>
	<li> Take it easy. It's okay to be lazy, do some reading, watch some TV, play some video games and not feel guilty about not doing anything "productive".</li>
	<li> Check out <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/MythBusters_Collection_1/70067548">MythBusters on NetFlix streaming</a>. It's a great show for geeks with lots of time to kill.</li>
	<li> It's okay to not shower every day. Just make sure you shower before friends come over!</li>
	<li> Invite your friends over a lot. Host some gaming and movie nights. Get dinner with them.</li>
	<li> Get out of the house occasionally or you'll go stir crazy. Even hopping in a cab to go get tea/coffee at the local bookstore or coffee shop is worth the money. Check out <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> and see if you can't find some local groups to get out and be social with.</li>
</ol>
