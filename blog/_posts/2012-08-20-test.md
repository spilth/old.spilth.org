My last real blog post was back in XX of YY. A few months ago I pointed blog.spilth.org to Tumblr where I've been posting about things I've been enjoying in a brief manner, but nothing as in depth as I used to post.

This year started off somewhat dramatically - at the end of January we had a fire in our apartment building. Nobody got hurt and the majority of our stuff survived. Kim and I had been discussing moving to Brooklyn, so the fire ended up putting that plan into immediate action. We lucked out and managed to find a sublet in Park Slope and subsequently an apartment opened literally down the hall from our sublet.
