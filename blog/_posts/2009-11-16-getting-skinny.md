I've gotten a lot of comments about being thinner the last few months but this post isn't actually about that.

On Sunday I went to Cunningham Park in Queens, NY with a friend from one of my mountain biking meetup groups. It was my first time at Cunningham and I definitely would ride there a gain. No giant hills, really clear signs and lots of fun, winding single track. And it's only about 35 minutes away.

We started off on the east side of the park and spent a good amount of time practicing on a "skinny". Skinnies are <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=mountain%20biking%20skinnies">long, narrow sections of track, often on logs or wooden boards</a>. They can be a few inches to several feet over the ground. I managed to get across it a number of times and felt good about it, especially since a month ago I could barely get across a piece of flat wood on the ground.

I had my camera, so I once again video taped what we were doing.

Next we checked out a area of jumps and burms, but I don't feel like I'm quite ready for jumps. It's honestly not a primary interest of mine, but I wouldn't mind learning how to do some jumping eventually.

After that we headed to the west side of the park where there was <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/18918250">lots of cool, winding, jungle-like single track</a>. On the way back out we tried the skinny a few more times and then made our way to the exit. Sushi at Mr. Wasabi in Queens topped off the evening. All in all a really good day of mountain biking.
