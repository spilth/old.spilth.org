This Saturday will make it 14 weeks since <a href="/2009/02/22/my-short-live-skateboarding-career/">I made a fool out of myself in front of a bunch of ten year old kids</a>.

Today I went back to the "ankle doctor" after 4 weeks of physical therapy.  The last few weeks have been pretty good. I'm getting flexibility back in my ankle, I've started driving, I really only use the crutches for long walks and I've even been able to start going down stairs normally. At today's appointment I finally got a copy of my x-rays:
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="I'm Totally Screwed! by spilth, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/3573314901/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2430/3573314901_1a04125014_m.jpg" alt="I'm Totally Screwed!" width="240" height="137" /></a></p>

The plates and screws are staying in me unless I start to find them uncomfortable. Then I can get them taken out if I want.

The thing I'm most excited about is the fact that the doctor said I could start biking! So at some point this weekend I'm going to get myself a mountain bike and do the first biking I've done in a long, long time. Keep your fingers crossed for me!

Being able to drive has also allowed me to get back to one of my favorite activities: alternate side parking! My neighbor hood has alternate side parking every day of the work week. To add to the joy of moving my car, construction crews have been taking away even more parking spaces as part of the work they're doing on some senior center at the end of the street. This is yet one more thing that makes me eager to leave this apartment and neighborhood.

Last weekend I picked up an HD Camcorder - the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=177&amp;modelid=17993">Canon Vixia HF S10</a>. Since I can't really afford to break myself again on a skateboard, I decided I'd try filming skateboarders and putting videos together. I figure it's another way I can enjoy the sport and potentially contribute to it. I didn't find any skateboarders this past weekend to film, so I may stop by the local skate shop and see if they are looking for people to help shoot their demos and such. I may also start taping our D&amp;D games, meetup groups and other such events.

I did end up going back to <a href="http://www.dropinskate.com/">Drop In Skatepark</a> in Hilburn, NY, but the guy who gave me a lesson didn't see the humour in me asking about who called me in to the ambulance as an "elderly gentleman". Oh well.

Another nice benefit to not having to use crutches all the time and being able to go up and down stairs properly is the fact that I can now safely navigate the NYC subway. This has been a money saver as I no longer need to pay $15+ to get to meetup groups downtown. On Wednesday night I went to the <a href="http://xp.meetup.com/26/">New York XP &amp; Agile Meetup</a> where <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> did a demo of their awesome web-based agile planning tool <a>Pivotal Tracker</a>. I've recently started using it on a project I'm working on with some friends and have really been enjoying it. The demo provided some more insights into how to use it and how it works.
