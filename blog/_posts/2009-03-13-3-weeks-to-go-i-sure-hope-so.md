So it's been about 3 weeks since my skateboarding lesson and I've been holding up pretty well. Occasionally my lack of patience gets the best of me but I can usually find something to distract me from being stuck at home so much.  Between my friends and family I've been taken out and visited enough to keep my sanity in check. I'm just glad I did this towards the end of winter rather than in the middle of the summer.

When they released me from the hospital I was in a splint and wrap which was quite bulky and couldn't be removed, so I ended up having to get some large sweatpants, something I don't normally wear.

I went to the doctor a week after being in the hospital.  For my first visit to the doc they took off the splint, took some x-rays and then, since the swelling hadn't gone down enough, put me in a bracing boot for a little over a week.

The plus side of the boot was that I could take it off to a) change my pants and b) actually wash my leg and foot, which was a relief.  Still couldn't put any weight on it and had to keep it raised.

At yesterday's doctor visit the doctor took a look, said things looked good, put me in a cast (I picked the color) and took some x-rays.  As he was putting on the cast I asked him, "So I'll be able to take my jeans off still, right?"  "I sure hope so," he replied as he continued wrapping up my leg.

I finally got a close up view of exactly what is in my leg (lots of screws and a plate on each bone) but still haven't gotten a copy of the image even though I ask every time I'm there.  I go back in 3 weeks to get the cast off, get more x-rays and maybe go back into the bracing boot at that point.

I still can't put any weight on it and need to keep it elevated.  Fortunately my job allows me to easily work from home, which I've done for the last 3 weeks, though starting next week I'm going to try and head in a few days and see how the commute treats me.

My parents have been here since the Monday after my surgery and have been super, super helpful with food, laundry and transportation. They are heading back home this weekend but coming up again in a week for something else.

They have been camped out in the living room so I haven't had the joy of hooking up my XBox 360 to the new TV yet, so I'm secretly anxious for that moment. I can't wait to play Fallout 3 on the new TV.

I hooked up one of my Mac minis to the TV so that my parents could use the computer and also use it to watch TV via Hulu.com since I don't have cable TV. I recently signed up for Netflix again so they are also able to watch streaming movies on the Mac.

I've always wanted an AppleTV but realized that since the mini has FrontRow built-in which is practically the same thing - plus people can browse the web on it. When I first plugged it into the TV I was amazed at how crisp and shiny the interface was on the TV. I ended up dropping the resolution down a bit from 1920x1080 to something a bit smaller so you can actually read the menus and interface.

So I may just end up leaving the mini hooked up to the TV even after the Xbox is in that room. I may hook up my 160GB external hard drive for the other mini that's housing a lot of my music. Then FrontRow will be very handy. The only thing the mini doesn't have that AppleTV does is a digital audio connection. Last weekend I bought the Apple Wireless Keyboard and Wireless Mighty Mouse, so that makes using it from the couch a lot easier.
