I moved at the end of August and that consumed a lot of my time in September. Then I was sick for a bit in October. It's November now and things have started to settle down a bit.

I'm still mountain biking and still loving it. I've been trying to ride at least once a week. Evening rides are harder now, at least if I want to ride in the woods but I'm hoping to join a night ride later this week. I think I'll need to pick up a better light though.

This past weekend I rode twice - once with the NYC MTB meetup group and once by myself. The Saturday ride with the group was excellent. We spent time practicing various technical bits at Sprain Ridge Park and a few of us even went for another ride afterwards. I brought my video camera and my new GorillaPod camera stand and took a bunch of footage of us.

The previous weekend I also rode with the NYC MTB group, that time in <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/17754893">a long ride around Lewis Morris Park in Morristown, New Jersey</a>. I really had to push myself that day, especially when I decided to go for a second loop with the group. I was definitely the slowest of the group but I managed to stay not too far behind. We did a bit of practicing on this ride as well, though not as much as this past weekend.

The weekend before that was a ride in Mianus River Park which was probably one of the best ride I've been on. That park is really beautiful and the guy leading the ride took us on <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/17086404">a really nice route through Mianus</a>. I'm glad I have it stored in my Garmin GPS.

Back in September I made the trek up to New Paltz, NY for mountain biking festival at Lake Minnewaska. I was initially disappointed because they had no single track but after seeing the following view my opinion changed completely.

And while I'm throwing all this video at your I should mention my friend Will's new band
<a href="http://www.gothamcitymashers.com">Gotham City Mashers</a>. Here's my favorite song of theirs so far:
