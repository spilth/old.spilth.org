On Saturday I embarked on my first bike ride in a long time. Probably 10 years or so.

After a quick hair cut in the morning, I head over to Danny's Cycles to get a few more items: shoes, socks, sunglasses, a pump and a seat pack. I also bought some electrolyte snack to try out.

I then headed over to the Tarrytown Reservoir where the <a href="http://www.westchestergov.com/PARKS/brochures/Trailways/NorthCountyTrailway.htm">North County Trailway</a> starts. I felt a little silly in my gear at first, but soon realized most everybody else on the trail is wearing something similar.

The first part of the ride was great. It was along the Saw Mill River Parkway, but set back enough from the road that you couldn't really hear the cars. There's also plenty of shade - something I'm a big fan of.  Between Briarcliff Manor and Millwood you have to spend some time on the shoulder of Route 100 which is a little bit of a drag. Cars are whizzing by and there was occasionally garbage or glass in the shoulder of the road.

Once you get to Millwood serenity returns and you're once again away from the road and shaded by the canopy of trees. After passing through Millwood and Kitchawan you get to cross a bridge on the New Croton Reservoir. The wooden planks of the bridge were "squishy" as I rode across them, like they were full of water and ready to break!

This is where I stopped to take a little break and enjoy the scenery.

After my break I continued north into Yorktown Heights. Along the way I came across a large tree that fell across the path. A cop was there helping people get their bikes over the tree and probably waiting for a chainsaw. I also rode past a skatepark but there was only a young, lone skater there so I didn't bother to stop.

By now I was pretty hungy so I stopped at the first place I saw in Yorktown Heights - some deli that is apparently home to the "Wacky Sandwhich". I settled for my own wacky sandwhich and got salami on a cinnamon raisin bagel. I also got some fresh water and a snack for the ride back.

The last few miles were a little grueling, but I managed to get back to my car without passing out. from Eastview to Yorktown Heights I believe I covered around 35 miles, give or take a few. 95% of the trailway is flat, so it's not like I was going up any enormous hills, but considering it was my first time out on a bike in a long time, I'm proud of the distance I covered. I do think I will take it a little easier next time though - I was pretty wiped the day after!

One thing I learned is that I definitely need to get some biking shorts. By the time I was heading back, my butt was feeling pretty sore and unhappy from all the pedaling/movement. Next week I'll be making another stop at the bike shop to pick up some shorts before I head out on the trail.

Perhaps next weekend I'll try the <a href="http://www.westchestergov.com/PARKS/brochures/Trailways/SouthCountyTrailway.htm">South County Trailway</a>!
