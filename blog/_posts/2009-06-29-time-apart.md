It's always the same at the beginning. You feel like you're the perfect match. You're excited at the possibilities of what you can accomplish with each other. You spend as much time as you can together, going everywhere and exploring new places together. You are inseparable and life is grand.

Even the places you've already been to suddenly have a new feel to them. You start to notice the beauty of the world all around you. Every little adventure you go on leaves you with a high that you can't explain. It's as if life couldn't get any better.

But then one day something happens. Something changes and doubt sets in. You start to lose confidence and feel unstable. Try as you might, you can't figure out where the problem is. You make adjustments but nothing seems to help. Maybe you even explain it to somebody else, but they take a look but can't figure it out either.

Eventually you have to give in to the fact that you can't fix the problem and you need to spend some time apart. Perhaps somebody else can sort out the issue that is beyond your understanding. Suddenly you find yourself sitting at home, twiddling your thumbs and daydreaming of your time together, fantasizing about where you could go right now and have an amazing time. If only you were still together...

Sigh.

Fortunately when you buy a bike at <a href="http://www.dannyscycles.com/">Danny's Cycles</a> they give you a free tune-up! That means they can take a look at why gears keep switching on me, especially when I'm going up hill in low gear, causing me to lose my balance and having to bail. It gets pretty frustrating!

That's what happened to me several times during my ride in Mianus River Park in Stamford, Connecticut on Sunday. At the last minute somebody from the Stamford Bicycle Group put together a beginner ride at 10am. I hadn't worn myself out from my ride on the Bronx River Trailway, so I most definitely wanted to go.

I made the 40 minute trip to the park listening to a bunch of 80's songs I had bought from iTunes the night before. Stuff like Tears for Fears, Simple Minds, Ta'Pau, Crowded House, Flock of Seagulls, Squeeze, etc. It's suggested that mountain biking is something you shouldn't do alone, so I've discovered that I'm excited at the idea of driving an hour to go riding with somebody on actual dirty trails.

I was the only other person to show up to the meetup besides the guy running it. I'm always worried that I'm going to be bumming out other people's rides because I'm still a beginner and shy about doing anything that feels uncomfortable or difficult. After my skateboarding incident I just want to take it slow, if only to delay any injury I may suffer. I want to enjoy myself for a bit first! Fortunately John (the ride leader) was patient and helpful.

The park is really beautiful and seems to be covered with trails of varying levels of difficulty. This is the third time I've been out on actual dirty trails and the third time they've been a muddy mess. I can only hope this will make dry trails seem like cake.

About midway through our ride my chain/back gear really started acting up. I've been having a problem where the deraullier seems to need to reset itself, right when I'm doing some important pedaling. last week it kept knocking off the plastic chain guard in the back which eventually broke and I just removed. I think that resorted in the chain now completely coming off the biggest gear in the back and rubbing against my spokes.

John took a look and made a few adjustments which seemed to help for a bit but eventually I realized I was just going to have to bring it in for my free tune-up. I decided to do it that day in the hopes of getting my bike back before the upcoming 3 day weekend.

But boy did I sweat on this ride! I feel like this was my first <em>real</em> ride. At the Fat Tire Festival and the clinic I went to we stopped a lot so it wasn't one long intense ride. I'm sure for John Sunday's ride was cake but for me it was a nice step up from what I've been doing. I had to bail on some things but was also able to take on some difficult stuff. We rode for about an hour and a half. I'm so glad I got that CamelBak!

Unfortunately I forgot to bring my camera on the ride so I wasn't able to take any pictures of the trails, the river or the big red barn we met at. Definitely a very scenic ride that's worth the trip.

I think this week's biking purchase will be a new helmet as I am using the one I got for skateboarding which is all black and has very little ventilation. It's also not very aerodynamic so I look like a big mushroom head in it. I'm also thinking of replacing my big front gear with a "bash ring". This is a metal disc that doesn't jut out like the big gear (making getting over logs easier) and helps protect your middle front gear.

Hopefully the 4th of July weekend will be filled with lots of mountain biking!
