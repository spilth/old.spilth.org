So the plan to find a means of exercise through skateboarding didn't go so well. It's time to execute Plan B!

Mountain biking seems a little less dangerous and bikes have built-in brakes, unlike skateboards. And the only trick I plan to be doing (eventually) are wheelies, which I was pretty good at when I was a teen. I could even do one-handed ones. Yay me!

Stu and Kate had taken notice of my interest in mountain biking and got me a cool book for my birthday in April: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ride-Guide-Mountain-Biking-Metro/dp/0933855265/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1243995069&amp;sr=8-5">Ride Guide: Mountain Biking in the New York Metro Area</a>.  If the weather is nice this weekend, I'll be checking out either the Bronx River Pathway (starting from the Kensico Damn), North County Trailway or the Old Croton Aqueduct.  The guy at <a href="http://dannyscycles.com/">Danny's Cycles</a> (where I bought my bike) mentioned the North County Trailway, so I may try that one first and see how far I get.

I'd love to take it out tomorrow night, but I'm planning to go to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-boardgames/">NYC Boardgames and Cardgames meetup</a>.
