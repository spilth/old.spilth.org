I've got a little workflow set up for recording and sharing what we come up with at band practice. This is mainly here to serve as a reminder to myself in case I forgot some of the shortcut keys.

- Record practice session with [Tascam iM2](http://tascam.com/product/im2/) and their [PCMRecorder iPhone App](http://tascam.com/product/pcmrecorder/)
- Transfer files from iPhone to computer using iTunes

Once I've got the audio file on my computer:

- Create new Logic Pro project with one audio track
- Drag WAV file into Logic Pro
- Press `G` to show Global Tracks
- Scrub through audio and find where songs begin
- Press `Alt-'` to create new Markers where each song starts
- Pres `"` to rename Markers to the name of song
- `Command-S` to save the Logic Pro Project

Then for each section I've set up with a marker:

- Click and drag the marker up to timeline to set it as the cycle region
- Press `Command-B` to bounce the cycled region
- Save as MP3 in a shared Google Drive folder for the rest of the band to access
