No, they didn't release a new version of Morrowind, but I recently decided to install my PC copy (I played it on the XBox originally) and give it another go, now that Half-Life 2 is finished.  Unfortunately my laptop is widescreen and Morrowind doesn't support widescreen resolutions (1280x800).  After doing a little Googling I found this forum topic: <a href="http://www.widescreengamingforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16&amp;highlight=morrowind">Solution: The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in Widescreen</a>

I'll have to give it a try when I get home - should be an even more beautiful game.  <a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/games/oblivion_overview.htm">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> looks sweet and I'm hoping to have some fun in 3 before it comes out.

<strong>Update:</strong> The registry editing worked, though <a href="/pictures/games/morrowind/">the screenshots I took</a> are a little dark.
