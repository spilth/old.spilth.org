It's been just over a year since I started mountain biking. I got my bike back in June of 2009 and have done a decent amount of biking since then. The majority of it has been on trails but occasionally I'll ride on the road or bike paths as well.

I got my Garmin GPS back in August of 2009 and according to <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/explore?owner=spilth">my Garmin Connect account</a> I've logged 91 rides and 700 miles since then. I'm sure there are a few that are missing due to a dead battery or import problems.

I started using <a href="http://www.dailymile.com/people/spilth">DailyMile</a> back in September of 2009 and so far have logged 703 miles and burned 475 donuts! (they have neat stats!) DailyMiles really is a great site and I think people should check it out for recording all kinds of exercising activities. I track my biking and yoga on there.

My technical skills have been progressing a little slow but I've been purposely cautious so I don't hurt myself. I love the sport so I'd hate to be knocked out of it for too long. I do want to step up my technical skills which means I need to step up how much I'm riding and pushing myself a little bit more.

I've also gotten involved in my local mountain biking group, the <a href="http://www.wmba.org/">Westchester Mountain Biking Assocation</a>. In fact, the link to their site is a newly organized site I put together in WordPress. The design is a WordPress theme, so I can't take credit for that.

I may tackle a map for <a href="http://wmba.org/blog/parks/sprain-ridge-park/">Sprain Ridge Park</a> next, but I want to wrap up the Graham one first. I dabbled a bit in some GIS and Cartography applications but am not sure that's something I want to put too much more effort into. I'll see what I feel like once the Graham map is finished. Still, it's really nice to hear that my map has helped get emergency services to people more efficiently or helped new people enjoy the park more.

So far this has mostly just been physical labor, but I'm okay with that. I've been reading up on cr

eating mountain biking trails, so I'm hoping that knowledge will become helpful in this project. There are some more experienced people involved so I'm ready to take a back seat and just learn what I can from the experience.

My friend Kate got me into yoga a few months ago and I feel like that has been helping me out in a few different ways. I should really step up how much I go though, because I need to take better advantage of my membership.

My weight has gone back up a bit since it was down to 193 and I need to make some stronger efforts to get it back down again. I'm not up at 240 again, but it felt nicer to look at myself when I was under 200. Hopefully stepping up the biking and the yoga (and lowering my calorie intake) will help me get back down.

In July, Kimberly and I competed in the <a href="http://muddy-buddy.competitor.com/event-info/new-york/">Columbia Muddy Buddy</a> which was a two person team race where you trade off mountain biking and running, along with a number of obstacles including a giant mud pit at the end. This was a lot of fun and required me to take up running for a bit - something I hadn't done since high school! In our group we placed 10 out of 29 teams and placed approximately in the middle of the 400+ teams that participated. We both felt that was pretty good for our first time competing in an event like this.
