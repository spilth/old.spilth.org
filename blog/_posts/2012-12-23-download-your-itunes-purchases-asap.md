title: Download and Backup All Your iTunes Purchases ASAP

__Important Update: Well I guess I look a little stupid now, but I got my TV Shows back so that's fine with me. It turns out that the majority of my iTunes TV Show purchases were just Hidden Purchases. Not sure how that happened but I discovered it in iTunes via: iTunes Store, Quick Links, Account, iTunes in the Clou, View Hidden Purchases, TV Shows. At no point did Apple Customer Support suggest or even mention this.__

*td;dr - download and backup all your iTunes purchases before they're no longer available which can happen without any notice.*

*Update: I'd love to hear from anybody else who has experienced similar problems. Did you buy The Walking Dead Season 1 and 2 and it's no longer listed in the Purchased section of the iTunes Store or your AppleTV?*

In the last couple of years I finally made the switch from buying physical copies of things to buying digital copies of them: Music, TV, Movies and Books. Things that take up space that I don't want to take up space anymore.

As a loyal Apple customer (2 Mac Minis, 2 Mac laptops, an iMac, an iPad, 3 iPhones, 2 iPods, and many more of these as gifts to family members) I've been doing this mostly through iTunes, except for books, which I regularly get via Amazon Kindle and [The Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/).

I made a bad assumption. I assumed my iTunes purchases would be available in the cloud forever. They're not. It's probably mentioned in a EULA somewhere but I don't think most people read those unless they're lawyers.

I'm pissed at myself and I'm a little pissed at Apple. But I suspect the fault is only my own for not paying attention enough and making assumptions about how "the cloud" works, so perhaps this will be a warning to others.

I've bought seasons of Mad Men and Downton Abbey for Kim. I've gotten us Louie, 30 Rock, Dexter, An Idiot Abroad and Portlandia. I've bought myself seasons of Hyperdrive and The Walking Dead.

About a week ago I turned on my AppleTV, went to the TV section and noticed that the majority of my shows were completely gone.

All I saw was:

- the latest episode of 30 Rock (even though I have a season pass)
- the latest episode of Walking Dead (even though I have a season pass) and one episode from Season 2
- 5 episodes from Lost Season 3 (even though I bought the entire season)
- the pilot episode of Andy Barker, P.I, which I think was free

No Dowton Abbey. No Louie. No Mad Men. No Hyperdrive. No Portlandia. No Dexter. All gone.

I guess I figured that the older stuff wouldn't be around forever but some of the things that are missing I bought in just the last couple of months.

What's most disappointing is that there was no notice that my purchases would become unavailable. I just logged in one day and they were gone.

It's equivalent to buying several TV seasons on DVD and then one day the store you bought it from comes and takes it back without telling you.

No, that's probably not the equivalent. It's more like I paid the local DVD shop for access to a TV show I like, they store it on their shelves for me to borrow when I like and then one day they decide to get rid of it because they need to make room for other shows or somebody else bought it and they didn't bother telling me.

I contact Apple support and here's the main gist of what they told me:

> If you don't see what you want to download in the list, it may have been removed or modified since you purchased it and is no longer available.

> The iTunes Store is not responsible for the loss of purchases. We encourage customers to regularly back up their libraries to an external hard disk.

The lessons here are:

- download all your purchases as soon as possible
- back up all your purchases as soon as possible
- your purchases can disappear from the cloud at any time without any notice

So for now I am paranoidaly downloading all the purchases I have made that are still available. You should too, as soon as possible.
