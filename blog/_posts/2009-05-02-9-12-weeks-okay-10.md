I went to the ankle doctor on Thursday and he upgraded me to "full weight bearing"! The only thing that bothered him is the stiffness in my ankle so he asked the physical therapist to be more aggressive with my ankle stretching exercises.

That evening I went to physical therapy at <a href="http://www.tarrytownphysicaltherapy.com/">Tarrytown Physical Therapy</a> and took my first crutch-free step in two and a half months! I was nervous but it turned out to not be a big deal. Jen, the owner, assured me that my ankle would not suddenly snap or anything like that. She wants me using two crutches when I'm "commuting" and one around the office and home. She said I can try walking without crutches to get to the kitchen and what not. I've actually been walking around at home a bit without any crutches and it's not too bad - I just have to walk fairly slow. But boy is it wonderful to be able to actually carry stuff in my hands! Guess that means I can clean up the apartment more...

I've been walking around a lot on my crutches lately. I've walked back from Tarrytown several times and have started to walk to/from Grand Central, if only to save on taxi fare. I need to keep the Air Cast on when I'm walking around long distances but otherwise I can take it off.

I forgot to ask the doctor about driving but I feel like with my ankle still being fairly stuff it's probably not a good idea anyways. I think I'm going to start going into work 3 times a week instead of 2 now, though.

In other health related news: my weight is down to 196 pounds. That's almost 30 pounds down from the 225 I was at in May of last year. Since I doubt I'm going to go back to the skateboarding any time soon (I want to enjoy my summer!) I'm going to take a stab at mountain biking. And by mountain biking I mean "riding a mountain bike on a nice flat trail in the woods". I don't mean riding on logs, hopping form boulder to boulder and flying down hills. I just want to be out exercising in the outdoors in enjoyable scenery. And if I have my iPod I can probably bike for a while without caring about how far.
