This blog hasn't gotten much love in a while - almost a year now. And really, I only posted twice in 2012. A lot has happened in the past couple of years and it's enough that every time I try to write about it it's a bit overwhelming. Even as I write this I'm wondering if I'll actually post it.

In late January of 2012 we had a fire at our apartment in Tarrytown, NY. Everybody got out of the apartment building okay and the damage for us wasn't too bad. The fire was between our floor and the floor above us, mostly contained between two beams in our living room. The fire department used hoses in that room so our couches, coffee table and few other things got ruined. Amazingly the TV survived after drying out for a few days.

We ended up finding a place to stay in Brooklyn for a month (we had been discussing moving to the city for a while) and after a month an apartment opened up literally down the hall from the apartment we were staying in. We decided to take since it had no broker's fee and we had gotten so used to the subways and places to eat in the area.

In April of 2012, on my birthday in fact, I had some sort of major panic attack out of nowhere. At the time I thought maybe I was having heart attack and it scared me. _A lot_. I got an EKG test which showed that wasn't the fact and that put me at ease for a while but the experience still had a lasting effect on me. I had a few more panics here and there after that first one and it became pretty paralyzing for a while. Racing heart, sweaty palms, dizziness, racing thoughts. I didn't want to drive or ride the subway. I was also worried about it happening while I was around others, especially friends.

Thankfully I've managed to calm down quite a bit from it but I still occassionally get a bit nervous about it. I got a few more EKGs and have been doing various things to help reduce stress and calm myself down if I feel myself getting worked up.

Lastly, this past July, after over 9 years at Time Inc., I accepted an offer from <a href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a>. It's the kind of software development company I had been reading about for years - pair programming, test driven development, iterative process, self organizing teams, focusing on one project at a time, etc. Admittedly it's been a bit of a challenging transition for me after developing by myself the majority of the day but it's exactly the kind of thing I've wanted to try. I'm enjoying it a lot.

So that's where I've been and what's been going on.

Hopefully after a few more months at the new gig I'll get back to posting more frequently on here. But maybe not. I'm not going to stress about it ;-)
