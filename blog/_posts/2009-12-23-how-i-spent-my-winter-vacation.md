title: How I Spent My Winter Vacation

For some reason I seem to forget to take vacation throughout the year. This left me with 2 weeks of vacation to use before the end of the year. I took them in the middle of December, saving me from a lot of the insanity of Rockefeller Center on the way to and from work every day.

My vacation started with <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20148529">a Saturday morning ride at Graham Hills Park</a>. It was an early morning ride with my friend Kim that we managed to sneak in before some rain that day. We practiced a few areas but didn't stick around too long so we wouldn't get caught in the approaching rain.

Tuesday and Wednesday were spent on the road to South Carolina. On Tuesday I stopped at <a href="http://www.destateparks.com/park/white-clay-creek/">White Clay Creek in Newark, Delaware</a> to try and do some riding, but the trails were too muddy to really enjoy or respectfully ride on. I was looking forward to checking out the "skills trail" to try out a few technical obstacles but even the first one freaked me out, especially because I was by myself:

I arrived in Bluffton Wednesday afternoon and decided to kick off my week there with <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20308718">an evening road ride around the gated community my parents live in</a>. It was also a nice chance to finally test out the helmet light I got a few weeks ago. The combination of the helmet light and a handlebar light worked very well, even in the foggy evening darkness.

Thursday morning I went for a ride with my dad at <a href="http://www.fws.gov/pinckneyisland/">Pinckney Island</a>, which I'm still not sure how to pronounce correctly. The ride was very pretty, but totally flat. I entertained myself by bunny hopping logs and practicing wheelies, enough so that I ended up breaking one of my pedals. We stopped at <a href="http://www.blufftonbicycleshop.com/">Bluffton Bicycle Shop</a> on the way back home to get me some new metal pedals and see if they knew about any local trails. This proved to be a fruitful stop because not only did I get fantastic new pedals but they also told me about a trail out on Hilton Head in <a href="http://www.hiltonheadislandsc.gov/island/Parks/parksandfacdetails.cfm?FacilityID=21">Crossings Park</a>. This place was just what I was looking for! Lots of thin, winding single-track and even a few hills and obstacles to tackle. I rode there are total of <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20344773">5</a> <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20388825">times</a> <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20554251">during</a> <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20593365">my</a> <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20625992">vacation</a>.

Towards the end of the vacation my dad decided to give Crossings Park a try and did very well! He even humoured me by filming some footage of me in one of the more fun parts of the park.

My dad and I also checked out <a href="http://www.dirtworld.com/trails/trail.asp?id=1889">Tom Triplett Park in Pooler, GA</a> but due to all the rain in the area it was full of puddles and hard to ride in. We <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20388723">lost the rail several times</a> but I guess it was still a bit enjoyable.

One of the more surprising rides was the one my dad and I did at <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/20554253">Folly Field Beach</a>. I thought it would be really boring but it ended up being a lot of fun. There were plenty of things on the beach to bunny hop over and the sand helped give me an idea of how far I can hop (not very). There were also a few rocks and branches to traverse during the ride.

I've been using my Canon Vixia S HF10 to shoot all my mountain biking videos but I was getting really eager to pick up a helmet cam for some more exciting videos. I had debated buying the <a href="http://www.vholdr.com/">ContourHD 1080p Helmet Cam</a> before my vacation but didn't think it would arrive in time. After discovering the really fun trail at Crossings Park I decided to order one and have it shipped to my parents place. It works great and looks almost as good as the Vixia.

I ended up driving the entire 14 hours home in one day which left me a little wiped the following day. The weekend snow resulted in my two planned mountain bike rides up here being cancelled but it did give Kim and I the chance to go sledding at Rockwood Hall Park. I wanted to record some rides with my helmet cam but we ended up getting there late enough that it was to dark to record anything. It was also a lesson in proper sledding attire!
