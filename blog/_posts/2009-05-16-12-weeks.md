As of today it has been 12 weeks since I <a href="/2009/02/22/my-short-live-skateboarding-career/">dislocated my foot and broke both bones in my ankle</a>.

This past week I wanted to go into the office every day (up from the 2 times a week I've been going) but by Friday my ankle was starting to hurt a bit. On Thursday I went into work on just crutch so I could also hold an umbrella and I feel like that was pushing things a little too far. I also went out to lunch a few times without the crutches during the week so that probably didn't help. At the time my ankle didn't bother me but I guess I was being a little too aggressive with it over the course of the week.

I worked from home on Friday and in the evening went to the physical therapist for a little check up, just to make sure things were okay. She didn't think it was anything serious and did a little work on my ankle to loosen it up. It was <a href="http://www.tarrytownthirdfriday.com/">Third Friday in Tarrytown</a> so I hung around for a bit, got a burger at <a href="http://www.lefterisgyro.com/">Lefteris Gyro</a>, a vanilla chai at <a href="http://web.mac.com/coffeelabsroasters/iWeb/CoffeeLabsRoasters/Home.html">Coffee Labs Roasters</a> and then headed home.

On Saturday morning my ankle was feeling better but I decided I should probably take a taxi to my PT appointment that day.  They went easy on me and things were feeling alright. Afterwards I got another "Loaded Lubin" at <a href="http://lizjohnson.lohudblogs.com/2009/02/26/lubins-n-links-in-tarrytown/">Lubins n Links</a> and then headed back to coffee labs for some tea and Ruby on Rails coding.  The weather had been gray and cloudy all day but since it didn't look like it was going to rain I decided to walk home.

<a href="http://www.myblogrules.com/">Andrew</a> was coming over so I decided to do some cleaning up. There were dishes that desperately needed to be done!  Andrew picked me up and we decided to get dinner in Dobbs Ferry so I could finally pick up my car after we ate.  We decided to eat at <a href="http://www.mexchester.com/">Tomatillo</a> which was really good. Their Super Nachos were great and the vegetarian burrito I got was pretty yummy. After picking up my car we grabbed some snacks at Stop n Shop and headed back to my place to play for <a href="https://gearsofwar.xbox.com/">Gears of War 2</a> and then watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852713/">The House Bunny</a>. I ended up just shutting the movie off about 40 minutes in but Andrew insisted that we finish watching it even though it was pretty painful.  The second half was actually a bit better than the first, but overall it was a pretty weak movie, even if Anna Faris was in skimpy outfits for the majority of it.

I also ended up icing my ankle a bit during the movie because it was still feeling a little sore on and off. Depending on how it feels tomorrow I may go for a little drive and pick up a few things. Unfortunately it looks like the weather may not make that easy.

I think I also need to back off some of the crap I've been eating lately. I'm excited to have been losing weight and don't want to put it all back!
