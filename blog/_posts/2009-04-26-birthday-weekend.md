Friday was my birthday and I had a very nice birthday weekend.

It started on Thursday when Stu and Kate picked me up from Physical Therapy and took me to <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/info-34577967-wasabi-restaurant-sleepy-hollow">Wasabi in Sleepy Hollow</a>. They got me some very thoughtful presents: a book on "cloud computing", a book on mountain biking and trails in the NY metro area, and a book on yoga. The yoga book came with an offer from Kate to "go to yoga with me where there are lots of petite limber chicks". She knew how to sell it! The owner of Wasabi put together an ice cream platter for me and everybody there sang me happy birthday. Yum.

On Friday night my brother took me to <a href="http://www.jamesjoycerestaurant.com/">James Joyce in White Plains</a>. Dave, Will and Darlene came out for that dinner. The place was a little loud with a Yankee game playing, but the food was good. Afterwards my brother, Dave and I went back to my place to watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zardoz">Zardoz</a>, which was pretty entertaining. Not necessarily good but wacky and entertaining. My brother got me the graphic novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(comics)">Ex Machina</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087175/">Dreamscape</a> on DVD and an album by Arcade Fire.

On Saturday I went to Stu and Kate's baby shower that John and Jeannie had at their place. It was a Hawaiian themed baby shower with good food and lots of "onesies". The weather was nice so part of the party was indoors and part of it was outdoors. I couldn't stop eating the swedish meatballs and some pastries that somebody brought. Fortunately I didn't have to do any grass skirt dancing in my crutches.

After the shower my friend Andrew picked me up and we went for some Chinese food for yet another birthday dinner. Afterwards we went to Gamestop where I picked up a play and charge kit for my bedroom's Xbox 360 and Oblivion - Game of the Year Edition.

Today, Sunday, I took it easy. Slept late, did a little cleaning up, played some Oblivion, watched some MythBusters and then cleaned up a little more. The toughest part of the day was bringing the revolving fan up from the basement.

This week will be another relatively busy week: physical therapy twice this week, the first meeting of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Agile-Developer-Book-Club/">New York City Agile Developer Book Club</a> I started with <a href="http://www.sethgottlieb.com/">my friend Seth</a>, and another trip back to the ankle doctor for a check up.
