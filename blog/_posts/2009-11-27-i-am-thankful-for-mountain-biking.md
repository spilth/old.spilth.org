I know my life has changed for the better when, instead of sleeping in on Thanksgiving day, I am getting up early to go out for a ride in the woods.

Graham Hills Park has been the best measurement of my mountain biking progress because it's basically where I started riding and where I've done most of my rides. It's also got one relentless climb that I've yet to do without resting, but the amount of resting has certainly gone down. There are also a number of technical sections that I used to shy away from and can now confidently ride through/across.

There's still plenty of learn and accomplish but I'm quite happy with my progress so far.
