I went through archive.org tonight and found all the major designs I could of spilth.org.  I registered the site back in May of 2000... wait a minute... <a href="http://blog.spilth.org/2000/03/28/lets-get-this-party-started/">my first post was in March of 2000</a>... er, maybe I started the site on alienwebshop.com...

Anyways, I made <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/sets/72157616474362201/">a Flickr set of all the designs that spilth.org has gone through</a>:

<a title="spilth.org - August, 2000 by spilth, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/3427219413/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3585/3427219413_6c4c3e1f87_m.jpg" alt="spilth.org - August, 2000" width="240" height="160" /></a>

I'm not sure if this was the original design of spilth.org but it's the first that archive.org has. Green is my favorite color so I made sure to use lots of it. This was back when I was still reading <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">scripting.com</a> and I think the sidebar was a list of blogs that I pulled from some Userland feed or something. I'm too lazy to actually read through my blog to figure out what I was doing then.

<a title="spilth.org, December 2001 by spilth, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/3427222115/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3427222115_097394571e_m.jpg" alt="spilth.org, December 2001" width="240" height="160" /></a>

I guess at some point I got bored with the 100 blogs sidebar. I was also revolting against all the tiny-fonted blogs out there and decide to make my font one size bigger than the default size, while so many people seemed to like to use one size smaller. Who could read that crap?

<a title="spilth.org - September 2002 by spilth, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/3427224203/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3613/3427224203_9cd5cd9e9d_m.jpg" alt="spilth.org - September 2002" width="240" height="159" /></a>

Another design I did myself. I think this one is pretty cool, if a little too gray. Unfortunately archive.org seems to not grab background images. The sidebars had some cool light gray images of a Beholder and I think an Orc sitting behind them. The upper left image is a silhouette of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)">The Avengers</a> and the dice represented the fact that I'm a RPG/boardgamer.

<a title="spilth.org - November 2003 by spilth, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/3427228353/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3406/3427228353_9abaf4564f_m.jpg" alt="spilth.org - November 2003" width="240" height="160" /></a>

Slight adjustment of the previous design.

<a title="spilth.org - November 2004 by spilth, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/3427233327/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3605/3427233327_7e547eea04_m.jpg" alt="spilth.org - November 2004" width="240" height="159" /></a>

Another cool design ruined by the fact that archive.org doesn't seem to grab background images.  These was my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte">Magritte</a> design. It had a cloudy background image and I turned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">Magritte's famou Pipe </a>painting into my tagline - This is not a web site. I was so hip back then!

<a title="spilth.org - August 2006 by spilth, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spilth/3428045878/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3428045878_2bb32e797c_m.jpg" alt="spilth.org - August 2006" width="240" height="160" /></a>

This is when I got tired of keeping up with CSS and all the cross-browser incompatibilities. I decided to just use some pre-made WordPress theme.

And as you can tell, the site has a new design. Again, it's just some Wordpress theme but I'm not completely happy with it, so I wouldn't be surprised if it changes in the next few weeks again.
