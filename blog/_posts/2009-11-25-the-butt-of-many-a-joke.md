There is a place in Connecticut that I ride at that provides no end of 3rd grade giggling for me and some of my friends. In fact, I believe the name of this park is a good test of character for people. I appreciate those who not only laugh at it but take up the challenge of coming up with their own little joke about the place.

This place is of course Mianus River Park. I've got to pause every time I say the name of the park, if only to collect my composure. Depending on the audience this is often followed by sentences such as:
<ul>
	<li>Mianus is actually really beautiful.</li>
	<li>There were a bunch of people in Mianus this weekend.</li>
	<li>It was actually too wet to ride in Mianus the other day.</li>
</ul>
And it's quite true - it's a beautiful place to ride and a lot of people (hikers, bikers, dog walkers) go there. And yes, it's generally frowned upon to ride trails when they are muddy.
