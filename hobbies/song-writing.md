## History

I started playing piano at a young age - 6, I think. I went through 3 different teachers over the next 10 years.

In grade school I picked the Saxophone and played that in both my grade school and high school band.

During high school I bought myself an electric guitar and taught myself how to play. I filled many cassette tapes with song ideas using my Tascam 424 4-Track. I still have them. I also played piano and guitar in the Jazz Band.  

I went to Manhattanville College where I started as a Music major but switched to Computer Science. I started a band called [The Laudry Room](/projects/the0laundry-room/) with my friends Will, Joe and Therese.  The Laundry Room record a couple of albums, played a lot of shows but eventually stopped being a thing.

I still write songs here and there, either with my guitar or my keyboard and Ableton Live. [My Sound Cloud](https://soundcloud.com/polymonic) has lots of songs I've made by myself, with friends and with The Laundry Room.
