## History

It goes something like this (and may not be completely chronologically accurate):

- Get a [TRS-80 Color Computer 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_2_.281983.E2.80.931986.29) with 16KB for Christmas one year.
- Enter lots of programs from [The Rainbow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rainbow_\(magazine\)) magazine.
- Saved up $250 to buy a floppy drive for my Coco 2 so I wouldn't have to deal with cassette tapes anymore.
- Accompanied my mom to my "aunt's" house where I would use her Apple IIe and teach myself Basic from a series of books.
- Tried to write my own adventure game using basic and ASCII art in 1st grade. On a pad of paper.
- Grade school computer teacher tells me he has a [Commodore Pet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET) program that can "play songs". He loads the program and it just prints lyrics. I am severely disappointed.
- While on vacation I visit a Radio Shack and manage to pass the challenge of getting past an employees password protected "Library" program by using the `continue` statement to keep continue the program after the password check.
- Whenever we visit somebody's house with a computer I ask if I can use it.
- Family gets an [Apple //c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIc) for Christmas.
- I fill up floppy disks with programs I've written or typed in from [Family Computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Computing) and [Compute!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute!) magazine.
- Attend Computer Camp at Mercy College. Learn some Pascal. Start teaching myself Apple graphics to make pretty [moire patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern).
- In high school I take a different bus so I can go to [HeathKit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit) after school and play with their Macintosh IIs. Call my mom and ask her to pick me up from surprise location nowhere near home!
- Tutor my mom and a number of other teachers to help them pass a [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_\(programming_language\)) class.
- Get my first "computer job" at [Datacap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datacap) as internal support. Ask to bring my desktop work computer home on the weekend so I can learn more.
- After years of thinking I want a Mac I ended up buying a PC.
- Quickly upgrade from 386 to 486DX2 so I have a math co-processor so [VistraPro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistaPro) doesn't crawl on my machine.
- Start working for Perfect Computer. Build computers, run coaxial and Ethernet cables, set up Windows and Novell networks for businesses, schools and homes.
- Attend college at [Manhattanville](http://www.mville.edu/). Switch from Music Major to Computer Science Major. Drag my computer with me to school on the nights I work at the computer lab.
- Choose [emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs).
- Create my own college course to compile and install [NCSA HTTPd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_HTTPd) and set up Manhattanville's first web server and web site.
- Help a non-programming musician friend pass his computer class by explaining arrays using a guitar fretboard as an example.
- Leave school and start working at ISP [Cloud 9](http://www.cloud9.net/). Learn BSDi/FreeBSD.
- Build my own [FreeBSD](http://www5.us.freebsd.org/) server dubbed [alienwebshop](http://www.alienwebshop.com) and start learning Perl, PHP, Apache and Unix administration. Build web sites and host friends projects on it for free.
- Work at [The Journal News](http://www.lohud.com/) and implement a system for publishing their Quark Express content to the web using QPS.
- Work at iWon.com where I learn TCL and develop their Games channel in Vignette and a webmail system in PHP.
- Hired by Time Inc. as a Vignette developer. Build web sites for People.com, TeenPeople.com, EW.com.
- Start reading books like [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer), [Refactoring](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) and [Pragmatic Project Automation](http://pragprog.com/book/auto/pragmatic-project-automation). Have my eyes and mind opened.
- Move to Architect position at Time Inc. building cross-site libraries for content management, advertising, analytics and video.
- Finally switch to a Mac. Never look back. Except for the Boot Camp partition I use to play [Skyrim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim).
- Start teaching myself [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
- Tired of reading multi-page error-prone manual build instructions, I set up a continuous integration server at Time Inc. and eventually automate build and deployment of applications written in Java, Rails and PHP.
- Read books like [Driving Technical Change](http://pragprog.com/book/trevan/driving-technical-change), [Metaprogramming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby) and [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec).
