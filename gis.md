## History

Some years ago I bought the book [Desktop GIS: Mapping the Planet with Open Source Tools](http://pragprog.com/book/gsdgis/desktop-gis). I honestly don't remember why I bought it, but it seemed like an interest thing to play with. At the time I was turned off by the state of the open source tools (they seemed to crash a lot on me) and eventually gave up on it.

Several years later I found myself volunteering to make trail maps for some local mountain biking trails in my area. At the time I had been using Adobe Illustrator to create the maps I was working on but the term "GIS" made it's way in front of me and I remembered the book I had bought.

I finished my mapping projects using Illustrator but started to teach myself GIS software using the [free training materials from ESRI](http://training.esri.com/). I am not in a financial position to purchase ArcGIS so I translated what I learned to that free and wonderfully powerful [Quantum GIS](http://www.qgis.org/). I've yet to "publish" a map I've made with QGIS but I'm fairly close with one or two.

After moving to Brooklyn in 2012 I started the [New York City GIS & Cartography Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/nycgis/) but ended up stepping down from my role for personal reasons. I'd like to return when I have more energy to dedicate to it.  GIS is still a new hobby to me but this merging of design, databases and mountain biking is quite exciting!
